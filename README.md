# University Management System

## Description

The University Management System is a Spring-Boot web-application designed to simplify university administration by offering a centralized platform for managing academic operations. It features a RESTful API that handles user roles, course organization, and student enrollments - all secured through JWT authentication and role-based permissions.

## Key Features:
- User Management: Create, update, and manage user roles (STUDENT, TEACHER, ADMIN).

- Course Management: Add, modify, or remove courses (FOR ADMINS), and track course details.

- Enrollment System: Handle student enrollments in courses with full CRUD functionality. (FOR TEACHERS/ADMINS)

- Security: Implements Spring Security and JWT for authentication and authorization.
